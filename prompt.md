# Your goal: Create Collab Canvas

Complete all of the features listed in @CollabCanvas.md and @CollabCanvas_Rubric.md. Make sure you aim for 100% feature coverage. I want everything completed, with no stone left unturned.

NOTE:

1. Create a separate commit for each logical change (e.g., feature, fix, refactor, etc) using Conventional Commit format and then push your changes straight onto the main branch. You have access to GitHub CLI.

2. Create and run the necessary tests to make sure everything is working.

3. You should have access to Context7 mcp for searching documentation and Playwright mcp for testing, so use those when you deem necessary.

4. I want to eventually deploy this on Vercel, so make it easy for it to do so.

5. I'll manually set up the Firebase and the OpenAI AI API Key, so just have placeholders there for now.
